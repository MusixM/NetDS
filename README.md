# NetDS
NetDS is a little app that makes you able to display pictures on a second screen while controlling it from the first one, or from another device connected to the same network.

Use the "configas.exe" to choose a folder of pictures to open at start.

Click on "rafraichir" to refresh the categorie of the default folder (exemple, if you add a picture in that folder after opening the app, click on "rafraichir" to see it appears on the first categorie.

Click on "+" to create a new categorie and import new files.

Click on "Contrôle en réseau local" to be able to control the pictures from another device on the same network. When you clicked it, wait. When a window appears, you can either flash the qr code or write the URL on the other device.

If when it loads a new categorie there isn't enough space, it will makes another page, click on the numbers on the top to navigate between pages.
